To implement the service layer in Domain-Driven Design, we need to introduce service interfaces and their implementations. Here is the extended UML diagram with service interfaces and their implementations for the given domain model:

```plantuml
@startuml
class User {
  +String name
  +String email
  +void login()
}
class Order {
  +int orderId
  +Date date
  +void placeOrder()
}
interface UserService {
  +User getUserById(int userId)
  +void updateUser(User user)
}

interface OrderService {
  +Order getOrderById(int orderId)
  +void createOrder(Order order)
}

class UserServiceImpl {
 + User getUserById(int userId)
  +void updateUser(User user)
}

class OrderServiceImpl {
  +Order getOrderById(int orderId)
  +void createOrder(Order order)
}

User -- Order
UserService ..> User
OrderService ..> Order
UserServiceImpl ..> UserService
OrderServiceImpl ..> OrderService
@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- `UserService` interface defines operations related to user management such as retrieving a user by ID and updating a user.
- `OrderService` interface defines operations related to order management such as retrieving an order by ID and creating an order.
- `UserServiceImpl` class implements the `UserService` interface providing the actual implementation of user-related operations.
- `OrderServiceImpl` class implements the `OrderService` interface providing the actual implementation of order-related operations.

This structure separates concerns and provides a clear separation between domain entities and their corresponding services.
